Welcome to my personal website! My name is Theodore Wu, currently residing in the beautiful city of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. I am an incoming Software Development Engineer at Amazon.

## Background & Education
Growing up in Victoria, I hold a deep appreciation for the beautiful outdoors and a peaceful environment. After graduating high school, I moved to Toronto to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Engineering Science (EngSci) at the University of Toronto. I was able to connect with people from across Canada who have broadened my perspective and shaped my future aspirations. My specialization in EngSci was Machine Intelligence, which equipped me with software and AI development skills necessary for meaningful contribution to data-driven projects. I recently obtained my Bachelors of Applied Science (BASc) in Engineering Science in June 2023. 

## Career
During my time in EngSci, I participated in the PEY program, which provided me with a valuable 12 month internship experience at Huawei Canada. This experience allowed me to apply my technical knowledge in a professional industry setting. Working at the Integrated Circuit (IC) Lab, I explored the intersection of machine learning (ML) and various aspects of IC design. For my project, I built an ML solution for predicting parasitic capacitances, a critical electrical property for IC performance. I then integrated the solution into a user-friendly CAD tool for IC designers. This role enhanced my communication skills through weekly presentations to senior designers and deepened my understanding of the engineering design process.

Following my time at Huawei, I embarked on a three-month summer internship at Amazon in Vancouver. I joined the Offer and Retail Catalog Service (ORCS) team and developed a data-driven log analysis tool that could be used to diagnose inefficiencies and abnormalities in the team's services. Using multiple programming languages and AWS technologies, I created an automated, end-to-end data analysis and visualization pipeline from scratch. This experience propelled my software development skills and instilled in me a user-first mentality when approaching software projects. Despite the tight timeline, the project successfully reduced theoretical time-to-resolution for a historical high-severity ticket from dev-hours to dev-minutes and identified inefficiencies caused by specific clients within the system.

Soon, I will join Amazon as a returning Software Development Engineer in Sunnyvale, California, where I will be returning to the ORCS team. Although the focus of the group in Sunnyvale differs from my summer internship in Vancouver, there will still be many familiar concepts and people. I am excited to explore the new opportunities that lie ahead in my career. 

Outside of work, I highly value my physical health and actively participate in many sports. I play badminton competitively, having played at a provincial level in high school. I also play tennis and rock climb at intermediate levels. Otherwise, you can probably find me at the gym. Aside from sports, I play piano at an ARCT level. I played keyboard for our high school's pit orchestra and have also performed at numerous private receptions. Lastly, I am a huge foodie and enjoy exploring new places to eat and cooking tasty dishes for myself. I always appreciate new food recommendations!

## Personal Philosophy
I prioritize the *process* of achieving my goals and make sure I cherish the moments along the journey. I believe that as long as we are always learning and improving ourselves, there is no wrong path in life. It's not our current situation, status, or possessions that are special, but rather, our lived experiences that are what truly differentiate us. After all, in the long run we all share the same fate, no?
