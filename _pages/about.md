Hello, and welcome to my personal website! My name is Theodore Wu. I currently live in the beautiful city of Victoria, British Columbia in Canada and I am an incoming Software Development Engineer at Amazon.

## Background & Education
I grew up in Victoria and enjoyed a calm, peaceful life in my formative years. I did well in high school and moved to Toronto after graduating to pursue an undergraduate degree in Engineering Science (EngSci) at the University of Toronto. In the big city, I was able to meet people from across Canada who have been of immense help in shaping my worldview and future ambitions. Within EngSci, I majored in Machine Intelligence, where I was able to hone both software and AI development skills that empower me to contribute meaningfully to data-driven projects. I have recently graduated and obtain my Bachelors of Applied Science (BASc) in Engineering Science in June 2023. 

## Career
During my years in EngSci, I partook in the PEY program which allowed me to intern at Huawei Canada for 12 months. As my first professional industry experience, I was excited to finally be able to put my technical knowledge into practice. I performed research work with the Integrated Circuit (IC) Lab in Markham, Ontario, where I examined the intersection of machine learning (ML) and various facets of the IC design process. For my project, I built a ML solution for predicting parasitic capacitances (a critical electrical property that influences performance in IC designs) and enveloped it in an accessible CAD tool for IC designers without ML backgrounds. In this role, I honed my communication skills through weekly presentations to senior designers and gained an intimate understanding of the engineering design process.

In the summer following my time at Huawei, I began a three month summer internship at Amazon in Vancouver BC. I worked with the Offer and Retail Catalog Service (ORCS) team to develop a data-driven log analysis tool that could be used to diagnose inefficiencies and abnormalities in our team's services. Using a plethora of programming languages and AWS technologies, I developed, from scratch, an automated, end-to-end data analysis and visualization pipeline. This experience propelled my software development skills to a high level and instilled in me a user-first mentality when approaching software projects. Ultimately, the project, although created during a rushed timeline, was successful in reducing theoretical time-to-resolution for a historical high-severity ticket from the scale of dev-hours to dev-minutes and was able to identify a set of clients producing inefficiencies within the system.

Following graduation, I will be entering a Software Development Engineer position at Amazon in Sunnyvale, California, where I will be returning to the ORCS team. Although the focus of the group in Sunnyvale is different from what I experienced during my summer internship in Vancouver, there will still be many familiar concepts and people. I am eager to see what awaits me in my career and look forward to the opportunities that will come my way. 

Outside of my career, I highly value my physical health and thus participate in many sports. I play badminton semi-competitively, having been provincial level when I was in high school. I also play tennis and rock climb at intermediate levels. Otherwise, you can probably find me at the gym. Aside from athletic pursuits, I'm also decent at piano and play at an ARCT level. I used to play keyboard for our high school's pit orchestra and have also played at numerous private receptions. Finally, I'm a huge foodie and enjoy exploring new places to eat, or even cooking tasty food for myself. I always appreciate new food recommendations too!

## Personal Philosophy
These days, I find that too many people are hyper-fixated on some far-away career goal and forget to enjoy the journey that was undertaken to reach their objectives. I place higher emphasis on the process of achieving my goals, in which I remember to savor every moment that life has to offer. As long as one is always learning and improving oneself, I don't believe that the wrong path exists. It's not what we have now that is important or unique, but rather our lived experiences that are what truly differentiate us. After all, in the long run we'll all be in the same state, no?
