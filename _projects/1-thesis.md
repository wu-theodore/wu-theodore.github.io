My EngSci thesis serves as the culmination of my undergraduate career at the University of Toronto. Over the course of a school year, I documented a full-fledged research work through the creation of a thesis final report and also gave a formal presentation of my research to the department. The final report is available for download [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /files/thesis.pdf %}).
