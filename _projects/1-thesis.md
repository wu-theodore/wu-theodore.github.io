My EngSci thesis serves as the culmination of my undergraduate career at the University of Toronto. Over my fourth year, I conducted a full-fledged research work through the creation of a thesis final report and gave a formal research presentation to the department. The final report is available for download [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /files/thesis.pdf %}).
