**Context:**

After my second-year of undergrad, I was fortunate to receive an offer for a summer research opportunity with the MultiMedia Lab at the University of Toronto under the supervision of Dr. Mahdi Hosseini. Myself, alongside a team of four other undergraduate students, were tasked with creating a comprehensive literature survey of the computational pathology research landscape. We adapted a "model card" format for categorizing papers and collaborated closely to build a complete taxonomy for the current literature. After two and a half years of iteration, the paper was accepted for publication in "Journal of Pathology Informatics".

**Overview:**

This article provides a comprehensive overview of over 700 papers in the field of computational pathology. We classify these works in numerous taxonomies defined across all steps of the computational pathology workflow and discuss common trends in the current research landscape. The work gives readers a holistic overview of the current state-of-the-art and a clear picture of the challenges computational pathology faces for future technical development and clinical integration.
