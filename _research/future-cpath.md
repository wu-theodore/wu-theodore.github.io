**Context:**

After my second-year of undergrad, I was fortunate to receive an offer for a summer research opportunity with the MultiMedia Lab at the University of Toronto under the supervision of Dr. Mahdi Hosseini. Myself, alongside a team of four other undergraduate students, were tasked with building a comprehensive survey of the computational pathology research landscape. We adapted a "model card" format for categorizing papers and all collaborated closely to build a complete taxonomy for the current literature. After two and a half years of iteration after we had completed our research term, the paper was finally ready for journal submission.

**Overview:**

This article provides a comprehensive overview of over 700 papers in the field of computational pathology. We classify these works in numerous taxonomies defined across all steps of the computational pathology workflow and introduce a model card format to do so. The work gives readers a holistic overview of the current state of the field and a clear picture of the challenges computational pathology faces for future technical development and clinical integration. The preprint of the paper can be found on arXiv [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05482).
