Badminton is easily my best and favorite sport, however during my undergrad it was difficult to find space to play in Toronto. At UofT, there are only three courts that are available for reservation to students. The demand for badminton courts is much too high for the given court space, so reserving a court requires a coordinated team effort of furious website refreshing two days in advance. I got tired of this process and made a semi-automated court booking bot to fight for court space. The bot uses a simple Selenium web driver and automates a set of user actions performed on specific elements of the booking website. The process requires human intervention to overcome multi-factor authentication, however I was able to use the bot to successfully book courts when I wanted to play. 

The code can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/wu-theodore/CourtBookingBot) for anyone interested in taking a using and/or improving it.
